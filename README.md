Examples of Use in Enterprises
	•	Customer Support: An AI assistant can access the customer database, order history, and inventory system simultaneously via the MCP. For example, when asked, “Please tell me about Mr. Tanaka’s order status from last month and the current delivery status,” the AI integrates information from multiple systems to provide an answer.
	•	Data Analysis: When the sales team requests, “Analyze this quarter’s sales along with the feedback shared on Slack,” the AI collects information from the CRM system, Slack, and spreadsheets via the MCP and generates an integrated report.

Examples for Developers
	•	Code Management: When asked, “Summarize the related GitHub issues, Slack discussions, and Jira tickets for this bug,” the AI gathers relevant information from multiple tools and provides a comprehensive overview.
	•	Debugging Support: When provided with an error log, the AI accesses documentation, past issues, and monitoring system data via the MCP to identify the cause and suggest solutions.

Examples for Personal Use
	•	Schedule Management: When told, “Prepare the related materials for next week’s meeting,” the AI collects information from Google Calendar, Google Drive, and email to compile the necessary documents.
	•	Research Support: While writing a paper, the AI integrates information from academic databases, personal notes, and reference management tools to support the research process.

In all these examples, without the MCP, it would be necessary to develop separate integration functions for each system. The major advantage of the MCP is that it enables the unified utilization of multiple systems through a standardized method.
